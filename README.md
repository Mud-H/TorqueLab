# TorqueLab v0.5 - Alpha
# TorqueLab v0.7 - Torque 3D Editor
TorqueLab is an alternative for the stock T3D editor included with the engine. It provide the same features and editors but various overall improvements have been made to make it more customizable and friendly with modifications. The backend system have been completly rewritten by using a modular approach which make it easy to user to adapt the editor to their needs.

> <sub> **Currently, TorqueLab is in Alpha development stage and is made available for testing. The informations and documentations available is quite limited for now but should be improved while progress is made. TorqueLab is currently looking for contributers to update the informations/documentations, if interested, send us a email at <nordiklab@gmail.com>. 
> It's not recommended for production use but it should not be harmfull, just make sure to backup your work.** </sub>

## Getting Started
At this stage TorqueLab require some minimal code changes to work properly. In the future, an effort will be made to make it work with stock Torque 3D by proposing code changes or by replacing scripts to work with stock code. For now, there's no pre-compiled binaries but some should be made available soon for those willing to try without efforts.


### Prerequisites

You need a valid Torque3D installation with the required code changes applied. There's various way to apply the code changes but the most simple is with Git. 
#### Get code changes from Git
Simply pull the TorqueLab branch into your repository and it should merge without conflicts. (If you have some issue with your particular code, I'd like to know about it so I could make it better for next time)
#### Apply a patch with code changes
Download the Patches and apply with your favorite tool. Patches are provided as .diff and .patch (Same exact files with different extensions)
```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
